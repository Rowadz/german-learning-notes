### 📖 Sound/Spelling Shifts in German Verbs

When verbs change in the present tense, some spelling adjustments happen to keep the **sound natural**.  
Here are the main rules, with **Arabic pronunciation** to help:

| **Rule** | **Change** | **Example (German)** | **Arabic Pronunciation** |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Long → short consonants | m → mm, n → nn, s → ss, l → ll | nehmen → du **nimmst** | نيمِن → نِمْست |
| Long vowels → shortened | eh → ē, ie/ih → ī, ah → ā | sehen → du **siehst** | زيهن → زِيست |
| | | lesen → du **liest** | ليزن → لِيست |
| ß = ss | ß is replaced with ss when endings are added | heißen → du **heisst** | هايسِن → هايسْت |


- These shifts keep **pronunciation** consistent.  
- They usually appear in **du** and **er/sie/es** forms of irregular verbs.  
- Arabic transliterations are approximate, meant to guide sound, not spelling.
